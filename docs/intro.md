# Helpers

:::danger

This package is currently under development. If anything works, that's a surprise.

:::

[Helpers](https://github.com/javaabu/settings) provide Laravel helper functions for use everywhere on a project. 

Here's a quick example of what this package can offer.

```html
<x-form :model="$page">
    <x-form-input name="title" :label="__('Title')" />
    <x-form-textarea name="content" :label="__('Content')" />
</x-form>
```
